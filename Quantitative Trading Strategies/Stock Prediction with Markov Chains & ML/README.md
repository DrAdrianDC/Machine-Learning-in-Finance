# Stock Prediction with Markov Chains & ML


## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Markov Chains and Machine Learning for predicting stock price movements. By analyzing historical stock data, we classify daily price movements into discrete states (Up, Down, Stable) and model the transitions between these states using a Markov Chain. Additionally, we train a machine learning model to compare its predictive performance against the Markov model.
