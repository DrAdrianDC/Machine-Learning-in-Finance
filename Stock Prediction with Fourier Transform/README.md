## Stock Prediction with Fourier Transform


In this project the main focus is apply Fourier Transforms for a predictive model to analyze and forecast time series data. 

Fourier transforms a mathematical technique that decomposes a signal in the time domain into its underlying frequencies. By analyzing the frequency components of a signal, we can identify patterns and trends that may be difficult to see in the original data.
