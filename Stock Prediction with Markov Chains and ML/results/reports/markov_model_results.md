## Results Analysis

## 1. State Classification Results
The dataset was classified into three states based on daily return thresholds:

- **Up (1273 days)**: Represents days with a return higher than 0.002.
- **Down (1107 days)**: Represents days with a return lower than -0.002.
- **Stable (368 days)**: Represents days where the return falls between -0.002 and 0.002.

**Observations**:
- "Up" and "Down" states dominate the data, with "Stable" being significantly less frequent.
- The frequency distribution suggests a moderately volatile stock with a tendency for directional movements.

## 2. Transition Matrix
The transition matrix reveals the probabilities of transitioning between the three states:

| From/To | Down    | Up      | Stable  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Down** | 0.402   | 0.470   | 0.128   |
| **Up**   | 0.406   | 0.456   | 0.138   |
| **Stable** | 0.391   | 0.470   | 0.139   |

**Key Insights**:
- **Down to Up** (46.97%) and **Stable to Up** (47.01%) transitions have relatively high probabilities.
- **Up to Down** (40.64%) transitions suggest a pattern of reversals.
- The stock doesnâ€™t stay in the "Stable" state for long.

## 3. Simulated States
The simulated Markov chain for 30 days produced the following sequence:  
`['Up', 'Down', 'Stable', 'Up', 'Up', 'Down', 'Down', 'Down', 'Up', 'Up', 'Up', 'Down', 'Stable', 'Up', 'Down', 'Down', 'Down', 'Down', 'Up', 'Up', 'Down', 'Up', 'Down', 'Down', 'Down', 'Up', 'Up', 'Down', 'Up', 'Up', 'Down']`

**Observations**:
- Frequent transitions between "Up" and "Down."
- Rare occurrences of the "Stable" state, aligning with its lower frequency.

---

## 4. Conclusions
- **Stock Movement Trends**: High probabilities of transitioning to "Up" indicate positive momentum tendencies.
- **Reversal Patterns**: Frequent reversals between "Up" and "Down" suggest mean reversion.
- **Forecasting Limitations**: The model does not account for external market factors.
