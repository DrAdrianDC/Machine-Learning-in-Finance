# Stock Price Forecasting using ARIMA Model


This project implements an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast stock prices. It demonstrates time series analysis using historical stock price data, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The repository includes Python code for data collection, ARIMA model tuning, and visualizations of forecast results.

## Why ARIMA model ?


ARIMA is a powerful time series analysis technique used to forecast future values based on past data. The model works by identifying patterns in the data and using them to make predictions.


## Features

* Stock data download (Yahoo Finance Python library )
  
* ARIMA model for stock price prediction
  
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  
* Evaluation with RMSE and other metrics
  
* Visualization of forecasted vs actual prices
